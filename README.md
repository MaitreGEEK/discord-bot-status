### Dockerfile
Use the dockerfile to create a docker of the app

## Routes  
*$ means they will require a token to work, set the token in .env or in specificConfig.json and then add it in headers Authorization: Bearer {token}*

- `GET /shard/:shardId` â†’ Returns the status of the shard
- $ `POST /shard/:shardId` â†’ Modifies the status of the shard *Creates the shard if it doesnâ€™t exist*  
- $ `DELETE /shard/:shardId` â†’ Deletes the shard

- `GET /shards` â†’ Returns the status of all shards
- $ `POST /shards` â†’ Updates a bunch of shards at the same time - each shard should have at least an id property, it will update to up by default 
- $ `DELETE /shards` â†’ Returns to reset as it's the same thing

- $ `DELETE /reset` â†’ Resets the database

- `GET /status` â†’ Status page displaying all shards and their states  

- `GET /styles.css` â†’ CSS stylesheet for the website
- `GET /favicon.ico` â†’ icon for the website

## ENV variables

- ENV API_PORT - changes the port of the app by default 6071
- ENV API_URL - changes the url of the app by default localhost (it's only for cosmetic)
- ENV DATABASE_PATH - changes the path of the database by default ./shards.db
- ENV TOKEN - changes the token for the application by default NULL (IT'S IMPORTANT TO CHANGE IT)
- ENV RESPONSE_PERIOD - period in seconds which the application will check if the bot's up or not, by default 60

## Functionality  

- SQLite database
- Uses `Bun.serve` for the server

- A shard will look like this : 
```
id: its id, for non shards apps it will always be 0
uptime: timestamp from when it was last up
ping: in ms 
status: down or up
last24hpings: an array of objects with all the pings from the last 24h with their timestamp
last24hevents: an array of objects with all the status from the last 24h with their timestamp
server: optional where this shard is hosted
version: this shard version (if your bot has versions enabled it's a good idea to have this so you can know if some shards are in new or old versions)
```
